# CMPG-313-Speech-to-Text-

Our lecturer for AI had a very bad accent. So for our AI project we decided to create a speech to text systems that is trained on the voice of our lecturer to transcribe his speech.

We did research and decided to use the wisper library as our AI model. We then gathered training data from his online classes. We then gave the whisper model these extra training data to help it better understand the lecturer
